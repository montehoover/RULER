Founders often overestimate the need to hire in order to grow, and this can lead to the fatal pinch: default dead + slow growth + not enough time to fix it. To avoid this, founders should start asking whether they are default alive or default dead early on, and should have a plan B in case they cannot raise more money. Hiring too fast is often encouraged by VCs who want to blow up startups, but as a founder, survival is the top priority. Founders should resist the urge to"

Now a lot of programmers have started to see Apple as evil. How much of the goodwill Apple once had with programmers have they lost over the App Store? A third? Half? And that's just so far. The App Store is an ongoing karma leak. * * * How did Apple get into this mess? Their fundamental problem is that they don't understand software. They

Most if not all the things we describe as addictive are. And the scary thing is, the process that created them is accelerating.We wouldn't want to stop it. It's the same process that cures diseases: technological progress. Technological progress means making things do more of what we want. When the thing we want is something we want to want, we consider technological progress good. If some new technique makes solar cells x% more efficient, that seems strictly better"
