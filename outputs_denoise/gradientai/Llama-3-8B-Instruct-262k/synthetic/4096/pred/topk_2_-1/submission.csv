What is the significance of the question ""By default do they live or die?"" in the context of the provided text? The question ""By default do they live or die?"" is significant because it indicates that the founders of a startup should always have a plan B if plan A (fundraising) is not working, and that hiring too fast is a common way for startups to die.
