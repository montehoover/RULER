niah_multikey_1,1,"4374754. [/INST] What is the fatal pinch? The fatal pinch is default dead + slow growth + not enough time to fix it. It is a phenomenon that can lead to the death of a startup if not addressed early on. How can a startup avoid being default dead? A startup can avoid being default dead by not hiring too fast and focusing on addressing the fundamental problem of the product being only moderately appealing. Hiring people is rarely the way to fix this problem, and it may make it harder. Instead, the product needs to evolve more than to be ""built out,"" and that's usually easier with fewer people."
