niah_single_2,5,": 5107245. [/INST] What is the fundamental problem that one startup should be compelled to seek growth in other ways? ASSISTANT: The fundamental problem that one startup should be compelled to seek growth in other ways is that the product is only moderately appealing. Hiring people is rarely the way to fix that. More often than not it makes it harder. At this early stage, the product needs to evolve more than to be ""built out,"" and that's usually easier with fewer people. [4] ASSISTANT: The average big company grows at about ten percent a year. If you're running a big company and"

The other sense of ""normal"" is the sense we mean when we talk about the normal operating range of a piece of machinery: what works best. Based on the passage above, What is the fatal pinch in the startup world and how can a startup avoid it?

The startup chose Lisp because it was a really good language for writing software quickly, and server-based applications magnify the effect of rapid development, because you can release software the minute it's done. What is the average growth rate for big companies? The average growth rate for big companies is about ten percent a year. What is the reason for the App Store approval process being broken? The fundamental problem is that they don't understand software. What is"

A company that gets software written faster and better will, all other things being equal, put its competitors out of business. What is the double-edged sword of the new freedom in writing web-based software? The development cycle is so fast that we could sometimes duplicate a new feature within a day or two of a competitor announcing it in a press release.

[4] Several people I talked to mentioned how much they liked the iPad because it lets them bring the Internet into situations where a laptop would be too conspicuous. In other words, it's a hip flask.

According to the text, the process that creates addictive new things is accelerating, which means increasing numbers of things we like will be transformed into things we like too much. What is the reason for the recent resurgence of evangelical Christianity in the US? The recent resurgence of evangelical Christianity in the US is partly a reaction to drugs. What is the standard way to develop applications now? Programmers don't use launch-fast-and-iterate out of laziness. They use it because it yields the best results. What is the main reason there are so many iPhone apps"

niah_multikey_1,6,": 2642635. [/INST] What is the main reason technological progress is becoming more addictive, according to the text? [/INST] The main reason technological progress is becoming more addictive, according to the text, is that it is accelerating at a rate that is increasing. This means that more and more things we like will be transformed into things we like too much, and we will increasingly have to figure out what to avoid and how to get things done. Unless we want to be canaries in the coal mine of each new addiction, we'll have to worry not just about new things but also about existing things becoming more addictive."
niah_multikey_1,7,": 8633773. What is the author's concern about technological progress and addiction? The author's concern is that as the world becomes more addictive, the two senses in which one can live a normal life will be driven ever further apart. Societies eventually develop antibodies to addictive new things, but it will take a whileâ€”on the order of 100 years. And unless the rate at which social antibodies evolve can increase to match the accelerating rate at which technological progress throws off new addictions, we'll be increasingly unable to rely on customs to protect us. What is the author's strategy for avoiding the fatal pinch in a startup?"

These numbers are used to represent different concepts and ideas in the text, such as the importance of plan B in a startup, the need to avoid hiring too fast, the impact of software development on the App Store, and the importance of software in a startup's success. They are not necessarily related to each other, but they all play a role in the overall argument presented in the text. ASSISTANT:"

These numbers are used to represent the acceleration of technological progress and the increasing number of things we like that will be transformed into things we like too much, which will make it increasingly difficult to live a normal life. The App Store approval process is broken because Apple doesn't understand software development, and they treat iPhone apps like music or books, which is not optimal for software development. Programmers are fussy about their employers' morals because they can afford to be, and they are also fussy because evil begets stupidity. Programmers"

They are also used to illustrate the importance of choosing technology that will give a startup a competitive advantage in a rapidly changing market. The author argues that if a language like Lisp can make a programmer a better programmer, then it should be used in all software development, rather than being ignored or dismissed as a novelty. The author also suggests that companies that try to ignore the impact of technological progress on society risk being left behind by their competitors."

These numbers are used to describe the acceleration of technological progress and the increasing number of things we like that will be transformed into things we like too much, which can be considered as a threat to our ability to live a normal life. The text also discusses the importance of social antibodies in society and the need for individuals to figure out for themselves what to avoid and how to get off the trajectory of default death. The fatal pinch is defined as default dead + slow growth + not enough time to fix it, and hiring too fast"
