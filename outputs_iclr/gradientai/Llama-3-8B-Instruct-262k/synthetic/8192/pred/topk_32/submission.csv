niah_single_2,7,"6440561. It is used to describe the process of technological progress that creates addictive things, such as alcohol, cigarettes, heroin, and crack. The author suggests that as the world becomes more addictive, the two senses in which one can live a normal life will be driven ever further apart. One sense of ""normal"" is statistically normal: what everyone else does. The other is the sense we mean when we talk about the normal operating range of a piece of machinery: what works best. These two senses are already quite far apart. Already someone trying to live well would seem eccentrically abstemious in most of the US."

The author's misgivings when buying an iPhone are due to the fact that Apple is an overreaching intermediary that doesn't understand software development, and their App Store approval process is broken. This has harmed their reputation with programmers more than anything else they've ever done. What is the reason for the author's misgivings when buying an iPhone?

We have created, for the first time in all history, a garden of pure ideology, where each worker may bloom secure from the pests of contradictory and confusing truths. The other reason Apple should care what programmers think of them is that when you sell a platform, developers make or break you. If anyone should know this, Apple should. VisiCalc made the Apple II. And programmers build applications for the platforms they use. Most applications—most startups, probably—grow out of personal projects. Apple itself did. Apple made microcomputers"

According to the text, the reason for the increasing number of things we like becoming more addictive is that technological progress is accelerating, which means that more things we like will be transformed into things we like too much. This process is the same one that cures diseases: technological progress. Technological progress means making things do more of what we want. When the thing we want is something we want to want, we consider technological progress good. If some new technique makes solar cells x% more efficient, that seems strictly better"
