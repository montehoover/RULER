[/INST] The reason for the App Store's approval process being broken according to the text is that Apple doesn't understand software. They treat iPhone apps the way they treat the music they sell through iTunes. Apple is the channel; they own the user; if you want to reach users, you do it on their terms. The record labels agreed, reluctantly. But this model doesn't work for software. It doesn't work for an intermediary to own the user. The software business learned that in the early"

The uuid is used as a tool to save a startup from the fatal pinch, which is default dead + slow growth + not enough time to fix it. It is also used to appeal to programmers by offering a technological edge that competitors do not understand. The uuid is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience"

niah_multikey_1,2,": 4694634. What is the main reason that technological progress is accelerating? Technological progress means making things do more of what we want. When the thing we want is something we want to want, we consider technological progress good. If some new technique makes solar cells x% more efficient, that seems strictly better. When progress concentrates something we don't want to want—when it transforms opium into heroin—it seems bad. But it's the same process at work.

They may know, because they read it in an article, that Blackberry has such and such market share. But in practice it's as if RIM didn't exist.
