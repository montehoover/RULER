niah_single_2,1,"3608513. What is the reason for the author's concern about the world becoming more addictive? The author's concern about the world becoming more addictive is due to the accelerating process of technological progress that transforms things we like into things we like too much, such as alcohol, cigarettes, heroin, and crack. What is the fatal pinch? The fatal pinch is default dead + slow growth + not enough time to fix it. How can founders avoid being default dead? Founders can avoid being default dead by addressing the fundamental problem with their product, which is usually not appealing enough, rather than overhiring. What is the author's"
niah_single_2,2,"2556017. Why is it important? It is important because it represents the number of people that a startup should hire in order to avoid being default dead. Hiring too fast is often the biggest killer of startups that raise money. Founders should resist the urge to overhire and seek growth in other ways, such as doing things that don't scale or redesigning the product in the way only founders can. This approach may save them from the fatal pinch, which is default dead + slow growth + not enough time to fix it. ASSISTANT:"

It is a number that represents the fundamental problem that Apple has with the App Store, which is that they don't understand software and are trying to act as an intermediary between developers and users, which doesn't work for software.

The author's concern about the Internet becoming addictive while he was using it is that he has seen it happen with most people he knows, and they are all trying to figure out their own customs for getting free of it. What is the author's solution to the problem of not knowing whether a startup is default alive or default dead? The author proposes that instead of starting to ask too late whether a startup is default alive or default dead, start asking too early. What is the App Store approval process and how has it"
niah_single_2,8,"2338687. What is the reason for asking whether a startup is default alive or default dead? The reason for asking whether a startup is default alive or default dead is to determine whether the company can survive on the money they have left, assuming their expenses remain constant and their revenue growth is what it has been over the last several months. This is important because the rest of the conversation depends on the answer, and if the company is default dead, they need to know how to save it. What is the fatal pinch? The fatal pinch is default dead + slow growth + not enough time to fix it. It is the way founders"

niah_single_3,0,": 1ff49b78-8946-4e85-b59c-de66bacfb3d0. Why is it mentioned? It is mentioned because the founders of startups that have slow growth are often encouraged to overhire by their investors, which can lead to the fatal pinch and default death of the company. Hiring too fast is the biggest killer of startups that raise money. Founders should address the fundamental problem of their product being only moderately appealing rather than overhiring. The alarm bells set off by asking whether they are default alive or default dead may counteract this urge to overhire and compel them to seek growth"

It took a while though—on the order of 100 years. And unless the rate at which social antibodies evolve can increase to match the accelerating rate at which technological progress throws off new addictions, we'll be increasingly unable to rely on customs to protect us.

What is the process that cures diseases and also creates addictive substances like alcohol, cigarettes, heroin, and crack? The process that cures diseases and also creates addictive substances like alcohol, cigarettes, heroin, and crack is technological progress. Technological progress means making things do more of what we want. When the thing we want is something we want to want, we consider technological progress good. If some new technique makes solar cells x% more efficient, that seems strictly better. When progress concentrates something we don't want to want—when it transforms opium into heroin—it seems bad."
