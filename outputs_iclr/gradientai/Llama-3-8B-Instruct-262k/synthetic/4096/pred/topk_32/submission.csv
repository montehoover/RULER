Most if not all the things we describe as addictive are. And the scary thing is, the process that created them is accelerating.We wouldn't want to stop it. It's the same process that cures diseases: technological progress. Technological progress means making things do more of what we want. When the thing we want is something we want to want, we consider technological progress good. If some new technique makes solar cells x% more efficient, that seems strictly better"

These numbers are used to represent the different senses in which one can live a normal life, and the increasing number of things we like that will be transformed into things we like too much due to technological progress.
